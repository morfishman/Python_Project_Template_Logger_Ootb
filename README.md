# Python Project Template with Logger (Out of the Box)

This Python project template comes with a pre-configured logger to help you get started quickly. Simply run the provided `.exe` file to generate a project structure with logging set up for you.

## How to Use

1. **Download and Run**  
   Place the `.exe` in your base Python project folder and run it. This will create the template structure with the logger.

2. **Add to PATH (Windows)**  
   There are two ways to add the `.exe` to your system's PATH:

   - **First Way (Recommended)**:
     - Move the `.exe` to a convenient folder (e.g., `C:\Program Files\MyApp\`).
     - Add this folder to your system’s PATH for easy access:
       1. Right-click "This PC" → "Properties" → "Advanced system settings" → "Environment Variables."
       2. Under "System variables," find `Path`, click edit, and add the folder path where the `.exe` is located.
  
   - **Second Way (Quick)**:
     - Move the `.exe` to `C:\Windows\System32`.

This allows you to generate the template in any directory by running the `.exe` from the command line.

## Features
- **Auto-Generated Project Structure**: Initializes a project with organized folders.
- **Logger Setup**: Includes a pre-configured logger that’s ready to use out of the box.

## Example Usage

```bash
python setup.exe
```
